        align=\\\"left\\\"\\u003EPart of what separates consumer Co-ops from other
        businesses is that Co-ops return their profits to owners in proportion to
        how much they patronize the business. Most co-operatives throughout the world
        (including REI, Organic Valley, and most natural foods co-ops) do this through
        a system called Patronage Dividends. Since 1988, the Lexington Co-operative
        Market has returned profits to our owners before we made them, in the form
        of discounts at the registers. Patronage dividends provide the co-op with
        the opportunity to offer a greater number of services to owners, our community
        and our future.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Ch3 align=\\\"left\\\"\\u003Ehere\\u2019s
        how dividends work:\\u003C/h3\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp align=\\\"left\\\"\\u003EThe
        Co-op provides its owners with a great grocery store. Every owner purchase
        is recorded at the registers. When the Co-op is profitable, the Board and
        management review plans and obligations, and decide on how much of the profit
        to reinvest in the Co-op. The money that is not needed to reinvest in the
        business is returned to the owners in the form of store credit or (if requested)
        a check. Each owner\\u2019s patronage dividend is based on the amount of their
        purchases over the fiscal year (July 1- June 30.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cp

        Few if any owners of the Co-op express excitement at receiving their 2% discount.
        At Co-ops that use Patronage Dividends, owners express excitement when they
        get their dividend notice and see how they have helped to contribute to the
        success of the business they own.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003ESustainable\\u003C/strong\\u003E:
        Discounts distribute profits to owners before we make them. The Co-op has
        been profitable in just 5 of the 20 years since the Co-op has been giving
        a basic member discount at the register. Dividends allow the Co-op to be profitable
        and to reinvest those profits into services that meet owner\\u2019s needs
        and impact the world on their behalf.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\n\\u003Cstrong\\u003EFlexible\\u003C/strong\\u003E.
        The discount level does not change based on the performance of the Co-op or
        the changing needs of the owners. With dividends, every year the board decides
        whether to return profits to owners or to reinvest them in improving services.
        \\u003Cbr\\u003E Dividends give the Co-op a tax advantage. \\u003Cbr\\u003E
        The Co-op does not pay tax on the income that we declare as dividends. The
        Co-op is required to distribute 20% of declared dividends to owners \\u2013
        roughly the same amount that it would pay in corporate taxes. Therefore, it
        benefits both the Co-op and owners when owners use their patronage dividend.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\r\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\u003Ch3

        is our year-round program to grow and harvest fruit and vegetables locally.
        During the summer, we farm using urban farming techniques in reclaimed vacant
        lots around our location. In the winter, we develop crops in greenhouses to
        ensure a steady availability of produce. Our passionate volunteers help keep
        this program going (and get some of the harvest on the side!), if you're interested,
